## Repository structure

The repository has three branches and the following structure:
  - Main: Data preparation, the CNN and MLP algorithms organized in folders. Plus a small dataset to basically run the code, and a folder with images used for this report.
  - Master: The initial “main” branch to upload our progress. Not used much despite a proposed initial files structure for the project.
  - Tests: Tests done during the development.
