The following lines describe the data preprocessing that has been done in a private server of the company of one of the teamâ€™s components. The original data from which the data is obtained is very large to have samples of it to be tested. 

The files considered in the preprocessing are described next:
00_Data_Preparation_00_Download_Precip_HighRes.ipyn -> Code to download the daymet dataset.  
00_Data_Preparation_01_Selection_points.ipynb -> Code to select initially 4000 points from the available grid of the daymet dataset and later reduce to only 50 in the Nevada-Utah region. 
00_Data_Preparation_02_Compute_Mean_Std.ipynb -> Script to normalize and remove the seasonal cycle to all the data required for the input. 
00_Data_Preparation_03_Compute_model_input_data.ipynb -> Computation of the individual input files for the CNN. 
00_Data_Preparation_04_Distribution_Precip_of_Points.ipynb -> Additional analysis of the distribution of the 50 points chosen and further reduction removing points closer than 100 km to reduce the size of the final dataset.
